    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working toward a good education and to hopefully get a great job with my education. I don't have any experiences that led me where. I'm working toward these goals by getting a good education and good grades also good attendance so meaning not being late or not showing up. If I don't s how up then I would miss learning and I wouldn't get a great education. Showing up on time and doing my assignments is a good value to getting good grades and attendance. Short-term goals is to graduate high school and maybe go to collage and work towards my goal for a good job. Character traits I want to be known as is a hard worker and a good listener.  </p>
